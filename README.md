# Run script
The data size and format may not be completely suitable, you should be adjusted according to actual needs before running the code.

You can find the main function to run the submodule.
```
python main.py
``` 
When you run the code, copy the data to the corresponding folder. 
`Placeholder.txt` is a placeholder file, delete it before running code.
